# Digital Check Register

<b>Summary:</b> A personal project demonstrating ledger-first design, AI-assisted reconciliation, and human-in-the-loop AI engineering. Built collaboratively with Claude Code.

A ledger-first personal finance tool with AI-assisted reconciliation.

> **Status:** Active development, personal project. Not deployed. Not production-ready.

## Why this exists

Most personal finance apps treat the bank as the source of truth. This one inverts that — the user's register leads, bank data confirms.

The principle is simple: I record what I spend, I track its lifecycle (recorded → pending → cleared), and I use bank data to verify what I already know. AI helps surface discrepancies and suggest matches, but never makes decisions on my behalf. The user decides; AI assists.

This started as a replacement for a hand-built Excel check register I'd been using for years. The web app is being validated against that Excel workbook through parallel testing — both systems entering the same transactions, with reconciliation expected to match exactly.

## Current features

- Six-state transaction lifecycle (recorded, scheduled, in-flight, pending, cleared, void)
- Computed running balance, current balance, and available balance — distinct concepts, separately computed
- Month-by-month carry-forward with a four-state lifecycle (open → ready_to_close → soft_closed → hard_closed)
- AI-assisted daily reconciliation: surfaces gaps between register and bank state, suggests matches, lets the user decide
- Audit log for every state transition, including silent updates
- Multi-account ready (single-account in active use)

## Planned

- Bank sync via Plaid (Phase 3)
- CSV export / import (Phase 4)
- Statement-level reconciliation against bank monthly statements (Phase 4)
- Auto-carry of opening balance on month rollover (specified, not yet implemented)
- Account Settings UI for managing routing/account numbers (Phase 4)
- Supabase Edge Function migration for the Anthropic API call (currently client-side)
- Playwright end-to-end test suite

## Architecture highlights

- **Ledger-first model.** "Current balance" (everything non-void) and "Available balance" (cleared only) are distinct, separately computed values. The system never tries to mimic the bank's opaque "available balance" calculation, which sidesteps an entire class of timing-noise bugs.
- **Deterministic state transitions.** Status changes are driven by explicit user action or by data (a `scheduled_date` column drives scheduled/in-flight derivation). No regex parsing of free-text notes; no inferred state.
- **AI as suggester, not decider.** The AI reconciliation pipeline produces structured JSON suggestions; the user accepts or rejects each one. AI never writes to the database directly.
- **Differential validation.** The system has been parallel-tested against an existing Excel implementation across multiple months, achieving identical reconciliation as the correctness benchmark. Unit tests cover the financial math layer.

## Tech stack

- React 19, TypeScript, Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- Supabase (Postgres, Auth, Row-Level Security)
- Anthropic Claude API for reconciliation suggestions
- Vitest for unit tests; Playwright planned

## Getting started

This project requires your own Supabase project and Anthropic API key. It is not currently set up for easy onboarding by others.

```bash
# Prerequisites: Node 20+, npm, Supabase CLI

git clone <repo-url>
cd <project>
npm install

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your Supabase URL, anon key, and Anthropic API key

# Set up database
supabase link --project-ref <your-project-ref>
supabase db push

# Run dev server
npm run dev
```

## Testing

```bash
npm run test       # Run Vitest unit tests
npm run test:ui    # Run Vitest with UI
```

The unit suite currently covers the `balance.ts` financial math layer (28 tests): running balance computation, current/available/closing balance derivation, in-flight detection, and currency comparison with half-cent tolerance.

End-to-end testing has been done manually via parallel comparison against an Excel reference workbook. A Playwright suite is planned.

## Approach

This project is built collaboratively with Claude as an implementation partner. Design and review happen in conversation; Claude Code handles implementation. SPEC.md serves as the synchronization point between design sessions and implementation sessions, and as a living document of architectural decisions and their rationale.
