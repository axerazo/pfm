## 1. Product Philosophy

This application is a **ledger-first digital check register**. It is not a budgeting app, not a bank dashboard, and not an AI financial advisor.

> **The bank is not the source of truth. The user's ledger is.**

Bank data is secondary and used exclusively for reconciliation — to confirm what the user already knows, not to tell the user what is true.

### What This App Solves

Consumers have no trustworthy way to know their real checking account balance at any given moment because:

- Banks mix posted and pending transactions inconsistently
- Banks do not know about scheduled or pre-planned payments
- Existing apps treat bank data as the source of truth
- "Available Balance" shown by banks is optimistic and frequently causes overdrafts

### What This App Is

- A rigorous, auditable, month-by-month digital check register
- A system where the user records transactions based on intent and knowledge
- A tool where AI assists with reconciliation but never makes decisions
- A platform where every balance is honest, transparent, and explainable

---

## 2. Core Principles

1. **Ledger-first.** User-entered data is always authoritative. Bank data never overwrites it.
2. **Nothing changes silently.** No automatic status changes without user knowledge. AI suggests; user confirms.
3. **Every balance is explainable.** The gap between any two balances is always visible and describable.
4. **History is immutable.** Past months are locked. Edits require explicit unlock and are permanently logged.
5. **Committed money is not available money.** Scheduled payments deduct from Available Balance immediately upon entry.
6. **AI is an assistant, not a decision-maker.** Ever.

## 3. User Authentication & Security

### Login Requirements
- Secure email + password authentication
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) required — TOTP or SMS
- Session timeout after inactivity (configurable, default 15 minutes)
- Password requirements: minimum 12 characters, mixed case, numbers, symbols

### Data Security
- All data encrypted at rest (AES-256)
- All data encrypted in transit (TLS 1.3)
- Routing numbers: encrypted at rest, masked in UI (`••••••102`), revealed only on explicit user action
- Account numbers: encrypted at rest, masked in UI (`••••3106`), revealed only on explicit user action
- Routing and account numbers stored ONLY in account settings — never displayed in the register header
- Audit log is append-only — no entry is ever modified or deleted, including by the user
- IP address logged (encrypted) on all sensitive actions

### Auth Stack (Recommended)
- Supabase Auth or Auth0 for authentication layer
- Row-Level Security (RLS) — every user sees only their own data
- JWT tokens with short expiry + refresh token rotation

---

## 4. Account Management

Users can manage one or more bank accounts. Each account has its own independent register system.

### Account Fields

| Field | Type | Constraints |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | UUID | Auto-generated, primary key |
| `user_id` | UUID | Foreign key to user |
| `nickname` | String | Required, e.g. "TD Bank — Main Checking" |
| `bank_name` | String | Required |
| `account_type` | Enum | `checking` or `savings` |
| `routing_number` | Encrypted String | 9 digits exactly |
| `account_number` | Encrypted String | 8–17 digits |
| `is_active` | Boolean | Soft delete — never hard delete |
| `created_at` | Timestamp | Immutable |
| `updated_at` | Timestamp | Auto-updated |

### CRUD Rules
- **Create:** User can add multiple accounts
- **Read:** Account details masked by default; full reveal requires user action
- **Update:** All fields editable except `id` and `created_at`
- **Delete:** Soft delete only (`is_active = false`) — historical registers are preserved permanently

---

## 5. Register Structure

### Monthly Organization
- Each calendar month has exactly one register per account
- Registers are identified by `account_id` + `month` + `year`
- One register is displayed at a time
- Navigation: previous/next month arrows + month tab bar (January–December + Yearly Summary)

### Opening Balance
- January of each year: user sets the opening balance manually (once, at account creation or year start)
- February–December: opening balance = prior month's closing balance — **read-only, auto-carried, never editable**
- Opening balance is stored as `register.opening_balance`

### Closing Balance
- The running balance of the last non-void transaction row in the register
- Automatically becomes the next month's opening balance

### Yearly Summary
- A derived, read-only view across all 12 monthly registers
- No manual input ever accepted
- Displays monthly opening/closing balances, total debits, total credits, net change per month

## 6. Column Definitions

### Header Row (Non-Editable)

| Cell | Label | Value | Type | Rules |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| B1/B2 | — | `Check Register — [Month] [YYYY]` | Auto-generated | Derived from active register month/year |
| F1 | `Current Balance:` | — | Label only | Static |
| F2 | `Available Balance:` | — | Label only | Static |
| G1 | — | Current Balance value | Decimal(2) | User-entered during reconciliation; see Formula A |
| G2 | — | Available Balance value | Decimal(2) | User-entered during reconciliation; see Formula B |
| H1 | `Actual Balance:` | — | Label only | Static |
| H2 | — | Actual/Ledger Balance | Decimal(2) | **COMPUTED — never editable**; see Formula C |

> Note: Routing number and account number are displayed in **Account Settings only**, not in the register header.

### Transaction Row (Editable)

| Column | Label | Type | Required | Constraints |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| B | Check # | Integer | No | Positive integers only; optional |
| C | Date | Date | Yes | Format: MM/DD/YYYY; future dates allowed |
| D | Description of Transaction | String | Yes | Free text; max 255 characters |
| E | Register Status | Enum (icon) | Auto/User | See Status System section; icons only |
| F | Debit (–) | Decimal(2) | Conditional | Positive numbers only; mutually exclusive with G |
| G | Credit (+) | Decimal(2) | Conditional | Positive numbers only; mutually exclusive with F |
| H | Balance | Decimal(2) | — | **COMPUTED — never stored, never editable** |
| I | Notes / Memos | String | No | Free text only; confirmation numbers, descriptions, user notes |
| J | Sched. Date | Date | No | User-set via date picker in edit mode; drives scheduled/in_flight status automatically; stored as YYYY-MM-DD; single source of truth for all scheduling behavior |

---

## 7. Status System

Every transaction row has exactly one status at any time. Status is displayed in Column E as an icon.

### Status Definitions

| Status | Icon | Color | Source | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `recorded` | *(blank)* | — | User entry | Row has debit or credit entered; not yet synced with bank |
| `scheduled` | `scheduled.svg` | Red ❗ | **Automatic** | `scheduled_date` column is set and date is today or in the future |
| `in_flight` | `scheduled.svg` | Red ❗ + amber row tint | **Automatic** | `scheduled_date` is set and that date has passed; awaiting bank confirmation |
| `pending` | `pending.svg` | Yellow ⚠️ | User action (AI may suggest) | Bank reports transaction as in-process / incoming |
| `cleared` | `cleared.svg` | Green ✅ | User action (AI may suggest) | Bank has fully posted and settled the transaction |
| `void` | *(struck through)* | Gray | User action | Transaction cancelled; excluded from all calculations |

### Icon Files
- `cleared.ico` → convert to `cleared.svg` (green checkmark)
- `pending.ico` → convert to `pending.svg` (yellow exclamation)
- `scheduled.ico` → convert to `scheduled.svg` (red exclamation)

> All icons must be converted from `.ico` to `.svg` for cross-browser compatibility and retina display sharpness.

### Mutual Exclusivity — Debit and Credit
- A transaction row can have a **debit OR a credit — never both**
- If debit has a value: credit field is disabled for that row
- If credit has a value: debit field is disabled for that row
- If user attempts to enter both simultaneously, display inline message:
  > *"A transaction can only be a debit or a credit — not both. Please enter one or the other."*
- Real-time field disabling prevents the error before it occurs

---

## 8. Balance Model

### The Two Computations

There are exactly **two distinct balance computations**. Three labels are used in the UI, but two of them (Current Balance and Actual Balance) produce the same number from the same formula.

#### Computation A — Ledger Balance
```
ledger_balance = opening_balance
               + SUM(all credits where status ≠ void)
               - SUM(all debits where status ≠ void)
```
Used for:
- **Current Balance** (G1) — the bank-side reconciliation target label
- **Actual Balance** (H2) — the ledger-side source of truth label
- These are always the same number

#### Computation B — Available Balance
```
available_balance = opening_balance
                  + SUM(credits where status = 'cleared')
                  - SUM(debits where status = 'cleared')
```
Used for:
- **Available Balance** (G2) — what the bank thinks the user can spend

### Why Three Labels for Two Computations

| Label | Axis | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| **Current Balance** | Bank | Reconciliation target — should match bank's "Current" after reconciliation |
| **Available Balance** | Bank | Reconciliation target — should match bank's "Available" after reconciliation |
| **Actual Balance** | Ledger | Source of truth — what the user can truly spend right now |

The bank's "Available Balance" is optimistic — it does not know about scheduled payments, pre-planned debits, or user-entered transactions. The **Actual Balance** corrects this by including everything the user knows about.

### The Convergence Principle

In a perfect reconciliation state:
- Every transaction is cleared ✅
- No pending ⚠️ transactions exist
- No scheduled ❗ transactions exist
- No unsynced `recorded` entries exist

**Result: Current Balance = Available Balance = Actual Balance**

This is the system's "green light" state — all three numbers match.

### The Divergence Diagnostic

| Gap | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `Current Balance` ≠ `Available Balance` | Pending holds the bank is processing |
| `Available Balance` ≠ `Actual Balance` | Scheduled/unsynced commitments bank doesn't know about yet |
| All three differ | Full reconciliation needed |
| All three equal | ✅ Fully reconciled |

---

## 9. Formula Definitions

### Formula A — Current Balance (G1)
```
current_balance = opening_balance
                + SUM(all credits, status ≠ void)
                - SUM(all debits, status ≠ void)
```
Includes: cleared, pending, scheduled, in_flight, recorded  
Excludes: void  
Reconciliation target: must match bank's "Current Balance" after reconciliation

### Formula B — Available Balance (G2)
```
available_balance = opening_balance
                  + SUM(credits where status = 'cleared')
                  - SUM(debits where status = 'cleared')
```
Includes: cleared only  
Excludes: pending, scheduled, in_flight, recorded, void  
Reconciliation target: must match bank's "Available Balance" after reconciliation

### Formula C — Actual Balance / Register Balance (H2)
```
actual_balance = last_transaction_row.balance
               = opening_balance
               + SUM(all credits, status ≠ void)
               - SUM(all debits, status ≠ void)
```
This is identical to Formula A. The distinction is context:
- Formula A is used in the header as the bank-side reconciliation label
- Formula C is the running ledger balance — the user's true source of truth

### Formula D — Running Balance (Column H, per row)
```
row.balance = opening_balance
            + SUM(credit column, row 1 through current row, status ≠ void)
            - SUM(debit column, row 1 through current row, status ≠ void)
```
Rules:
- If row has neither debit nor credit: balance cell is blank
- Always includes opening balance — every row shows a true account balance
- **Never stored in the database** — always computed on read
- Void rows do not affect the running balance of subsequent rows

### Formula E — Monthly Carry-Forward (Normalized)
```
current_month.opening_balance = prior_month.last_transaction_row.balance
```
One rule. Every month. No exceptions.  
January: opening balance set manually by user at account/year initialization  
February–December: opening balance = prior month closing balance, read-only, auto-carried

## 10. Status Transition Rules

### Complete Transition Map

```
[blank / recorded]
  ↓ User sets scheduled_date via Column J date picker
[SCHEDULED ❗ red icon]  (status derived at save time; also restored at read time)
  ↓ scheduled_date passes (system date > scheduled_date)
[IN-FLIGHT ❗ red icon + amber row tint + tooltip]
  ↓ User marks as pending OR cleared (or AI suggests)
[PENDING ⚠️]  OR  [CLEARED ✅]
  ↓ (if pending) Bank posts; user/AI confirms
[CLEARED ✅]  ← final state

User clears scheduled_date (clicks ×):
  → If status was scheduled or in_flight → auto-reset to recorded
  → Toast: "Scheduled date removed — status reset to recorded"
  → If user had manually changed status (e.g. pending) → no auto-reset

Any state → [VOID] via explicit user action + confirmation prompt
VOID rows are excluded from all balance computations
Audit entry created for every status transition
```

### Scheduled Date Rule (Column J)
- **Trigger:** User sets a date in the `scheduled_date` field (Column J) via the inline date picker
- **Action:** Status is derived at save time — `scheduled` if date is today or future, `in_flight` if date has already passed
- **Auto-restore on load:** If `status = 'recorded'` AND `scheduled_date IS NOT NULL` AND `scheduled_date >= today` → displayed as `scheduled` at read time (corrects stale DB state)
- **Icon preview:** While editing, the scheduled icon appears in Column E as soon as a date is entered — no save required
- **`scheduled_date` is the single source of truth** for all scheduling behavior. Notes/Memos (Column I) is now free text only and has no effect on status.

### In-Flight Transition Rule
- **Trigger:** `scheduled_date` is set AND system date is after `scheduled_date`
- **Action:** Row receives amber/orange visual tint; tooltip appears
- **Tooltip text:** `"Payment date passed — awaiting bank confirmation"`
- **Icon:** Red scheduled icon remains — it is NOT removed
- **No silent status change** — user is always informed, never surprised

### Scheduled Date Clear Rule
- **Trigger:** User clicks × to clear `scheduled_date`
- **If status was `scheduled` or `in_flight`:** Status auto-resets to `recorded`; toast notification displayed for 4 seconds
- **If user had manually set status** (e.g. `pending`, `cleared`) before clearing the date: status is respected — no auto-reset
- Confirmation number and all other notes content is untouched

### Pending Status Rule
- **Source:** Bank reports transaction as "in-process" or "incoming" during reconciliation
- **Action:** User manually marks as pending, OR AI suggests and user confirms
- **Visual:** Yellow pending icon in Column E

### Cleared Status Rule
- **Source:** Bank confirms transaction fully posted and settled
- **Action:** User manually marks as cleared, OR AI suggests and user confirms
- **Visual:** Green cleared icon in Column E

### Void Rule
- Available from any status
- Requires explicit user action + confirmation prompt
- Void transactions are struck through visually
- Excluded from ALL balance computations
- Cannot be permanently deleted — void is the final deletable state
- Audit entry created

---

## 11. Monthly Register Rules

### Display
- One month displayed at a time
- Month navigation: left/right arrows + tab bar at bottom (January–December + Yearly Summary)
- Current month is default view on login
- Register title: `Check Register — [Month Name] [YYYY]`

### Row Behavior
- Each row represents one transaction
- Rows are ordered by entry sequence within the month (not auto-sorted by date)
- Inline editing — click any editable cell to edit
- Autosave — changes save automatically on cell blur or Enter key
- Row limit: 220 transaction rows per month (matching Excel system capacity)

### Visual Row States
| State | Visual Treatment |
|---|---|
| `recorded` (blank) | Normal row |
| `scheduled` | Normal row + red icon in E |
| `in_flight` | Amber/orange row tint + red icon in E |
| `pending` | Subtle blue-gray tint + yellow icon in E |
| `cleared` | Slight green tint or checkmark only — understated |
| `void` | Struck-through text, grayed out |

### Yearly Summary Tab
- Read-only derived view
- No manual input accepted
- Displays per month: opening balance, total credits, total debits, net change, closing balance
- Annual totals row at bottom

### Month Status State Machine

Every register has a `month_status` field that tracks its lifecycle:

| Status | Meaning | Editable | UI |
|---|---|---|---|
| `open` | Default; has uncleared transactions | Yes | Normal |
| `ready_to_close` | All non-void transactions cleared | Yes | Close prompt shown once |
| `soft_closed` | User closed; next month still open | No (`is_locked = true`) | "Reopen [Month]" button |
| `hard_closed` | Next month also closed; fully archived | No (`is_locked = true`) | "🔒 Archived" + unlock dialog |

**Transitions:**
- `open` → `ready_to_close`: automatic when all non-void transactions reach `cleared` status
- `ready_to_close` → `open`: automatic when any non-cleared transaction is added or editing reverts a cleared transaction
- `ready_to_close` → `soft_closed`: explicit user action ("Close & Archive")
- `soft_closed` → `open`: user clicks "Reopen" (no confirmation, no audit, only while next month is not soft_closed)
- `soft_closed` → `hard_closed`: automatic when the next sequential month transitions to `soft_closed`
- `hard_closed` → editable session: existing unlock dialog + full audit log (existing flow, preserved)

### Opening Balance Carry-Forward Rule (Revised)

Next month's `opening_balance` = the running balance at the last **cleared** transaction in the prior month, computed by iterating transactions in `row_order` sequence. Running balance includes all non-void transactions; the "snapshot" is recorded each time a cleared transaction is encountered.

This updates **silently** (no prompt) whenever any transaction in the prior month changes status. Guards:
- Never updates a locked (`is_locked = true`) next month
- Never updates when the source month is `soft_closed` or `hard_closed`

### Close & Archive Flow

Triggered when the user clicks "Close & Archive [Month]" from the ready-to-close prompt:

**Happy path** (closing balance = next month opening, or no next month):
- Prompt: "✅ All [Month] transactions are cleared. [Month]'s final balance is $X. Ready to close?"
- Buttons: `[ Not Yet ]` | `[ Close & Archive [Month] ]`

**Unhappy path** (discrepancy between closing and next month opening):
- Prompt shows the dollar difference and both amounts
- Buttons: `[ Use [Month]'s closing balance — $X ]` | `[ Keep [Next Month]'s opening balance — $X ]` | `[ Explain the difference ]` (Phase 2 AI)
- `[ Keep [Next Month]'s opening balance ]` requires a non-empty reason text input before it becomes enabled; reason is saved to the audit log `reason` field

### Unhappy Path Prompt Suppression Rule

The opening balance mismatch prompt displays whenever **ALL** of the following are true:
1. Current month status is `open` or `ready_to_close`
2. A mismatch exists between current month closing balance and next month's opening balance
3. Next month has `is_manual_opening = true`

The prompt is suppressed when **ANY** of the following are true:
1. Current month status is `soft_closed` or `hard_closed`
2. No mismatch exists (balances are equal within half-cent tolerance)
3. Next month has `is_manual_opening = false`

**Persistence behavior:** The prompt re-appears on every navigation to the month until the month is archived. This is correct — the mismatch is unresolved until the user commits to a final decision via Close & Archive. Once archived (`soft_closed`), the decision is permanent and the prompt never fires again for that month unless it is reopened via the unlock flow.

There is no intermediate "acknowledged but not yet archived" suppression state. Clicking `[ Keep [Next Month]'s opening balance ]` in the unhappy close prompt resolves the discrepancy decision for the archive action only; it does not suppress the prompt on subsequent navigation before archiving.

**On confirm (either path):**
- `month_status = 'soft_closed'`
- `is_locked = true`
- Next month's `opening_balance` set to this month's closing balance (if "Use closing" chosen)
- Audit log: `action = 'month_soft_closed'`
- If prior month is `soft_closed` → prior month auto-upgrades to `hard_closed`, audit logged

---

## 12. Locked Month & Audit Log

### Locking Rules
- The **current month** is always editable
- **Past months** are locked by default (read-only)
- **Future months** are read-only until they become the current month

### Unlocking a Locked Month
1. User navigates to a past month
2. Lock indicator displayed: `🔒 Locked — This register is closed`
3. User clicks `[ Unlock to Edit ]`
4. Confirmation dialog: *"You are about to edit a closed register. All changes will be logged with a timestamp. Continue?"*
5. User confirms → month becomes editable for the session
6. Every save in an unlocked past month writes an audit entry
7. Month can be manually re-locked by user, OR auto-re-locks at end of session

### Audit Log Schema
```
AuditEntry {
  id:               UUID          auto-generated
  user_id:          UUID          foreign key
  account_id:       UUID          foreign key
  register_id:      UUID          foreign key
  transaction_id:   UUID?         foreign key (null for register-level actions)
  action:           Enum          unlocked | edited | deleted | voided | re-locked | status_changed
  field_changed:    String?       which column was modified
  value_before:     String?       prior value (serialized)
  value_after:      String?       new value (serialized)
  reason:           String?       optional user-entered note explaining the edit
  timestamp:        Timestamp     immutable, server-side
  ip_address:       String        encrypted
}
```

### Audit Log Rules
- **Append-only** — no entry is ever modified or deleted, by anyone
- Covers: all edits to locked months, all status transitions, all void actions, all unlock events
- Viewable by user in account settings (read-only view)
- Future: exportable as CSV for personal records

## 13. Reconciliation System

### What Reconciliation Means in This App
Reconciliation is the process of confirming that the user's ledger matches the bank's records. It is performed by the user (assisted by AI), not automated.

### Reconciliation Workflow
1. User opens current month register
2. User enters bank's current reported balances into header fields (G1, G2)
3. App computes Actual Balance (H2) from ledger
4. Reconciliation status indicator compares the three values
5. AI identifies unmatched transactions and explains gaps
6. User updates transaction statuses based on AI suggestions
7. When all three balances converge: reconciliation is complete ✅

### Reconciliation Status Indicator (Header)
```
Unreconciled state:
  ⚠️ Reconciliation needed
  Gap: $X,XXX.XX in unresolved transactions
  [N scheduled]  [N pending]  [N unsynced]

Reconciled state:
  ✅ Fully reconciled — all balances match
```

### Gap Explanation (AI-Generated)
When gaps exist, AI provides a plain-language explanation:
> *"Your $2,965.37 gap consists of 8 scheduled payments totaling $2,681.68 and 1 pending transaction of $251.86. Everything is accounted for."*

### What AI Does in This App
| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| Status suggestions | Suggests marking transactions as `pending` based on age and scheduled dates |
| Gap explanation | Explains in plain language why actual ≠ available balance |
| Discrepancy flagging | Flags anomalies: duplicate amounts, long-overdue in-flight, missing confirmations |
| Reconciliation summary | Produces a headline and status (`reconciled` / `in_progress` / `needs_attention`) |

### What AI Does NOT Do
- AI does **not** automatically update any transaction status
- AI does **not** make financial decisions
- AI does **not** manage budgets or categorize spending
- AI does **not** connect to the bank without explicit user initiation
- AI does **not** overwrite user-entered data, ever

### AI Interaction Model
```
User clicks "Reconcile"
  → reconciliation_session_started audit entry written
  → buildReconciliationContext() builds payload
  → runReconciliationSession() calls Claude API
  → ReconciliationPanel slides in with results

For each suggestion:
  Accept → transaction status updated + ai_suggestion_accepted audit entry
  Ignore → ai_suggestion_ignored audit entry (no data change)

User clicks Done
  → reconciliation_session_completed audit entry (accepted/ignored counts)
  → Panel closes; register view returns to full width
```

### Audit actions (§12)
| Action | When |
|---|---|
| `reconciliation_session_started` | Reconcile button clicked (before API call) |
| `reconciliation_session_completed` | Done clicked; value_after = `{accepted, ignored, status}` JSON |
| `ai_suggestion_accepted` | User accepts a suggestion with suggested_status |
| `ai_suggestion_ignored` | User clicks Ignore |

### Error handling
| Condition | Message shown |
|---|---|
| API timeout (> 30s) | "Analysis is taking longer than expected. Please try again." |
| Parse error | "Unable to parse AI response. Please try again." |
| API error (non-200) | "Reconciliation service unavailable. Please try again later." |
| Network failure | "No connection. Please check your network and try again." |

All errors show inline below the Reconcile button with a "Try again" label (re-clicking the button).

### Balance Computation (Application Layer — Never SQL Stored)
```typescript
function computeRunningBalance(
  openingBalance: number,
  transactions: Transaction[]
): Transaction[] {
  let running = openingBalance;
  return transactions.map(tx => {
    if (tx.status === 'void' || (!tx.debit && !tx.credit)) {
      return { ...tx, balance: null };
    }
    running += (tx.credit ?? 0) - (tx.debit ?? 0);
    return { ...tx, balance: running };
  });
}

function computeCurrentBalance(
  openingBalance: number,
  transactions: Transaction[]
): number {
  return transactions
    .filter(tx => tx.status !== 'void')
    .reduce((acc, tx) => acc + (tx.credit ?? 0) - (tx.debit ?? 0), openingBalance);
}

function computeAvailableBalance(
  openingBalance: number,
  transactions: Transaction[]
): number {
  return transactions
    .filter(tx => tx.status === 'cleared')
    .reduce((acc, tx) => acc + (tx.credit ?? 0) - (tx.debit ?? 0), openingBalance);
}

// Current Balance = Actual Balance (same computation, two labels)
const actualBalance = computeCurrentBalance(openingBalance, transactions);
const availableBalance = computeAvailableBalance(openingBalance, transactions);

// Convergence test
const isFullyReconciled =
  actualBalance === availableBalance &&
  actualBalance === register.current_bank_bal &&
  availableBalance === register.available_bank_bal;
```

```

### Header — Balance Display (Phase 1)
- **Single column**, two computed ledger values — no bank input fields
- **Actual Balance** (large, bold, green/red): opening + all non-void debits/credits — the user's source of truth
- **Available Balance** (secondary): opening + cleared debits/credits only — what is confirmed settled
- Bank balance input fields (`current_bank_bal`, `available_bank_bal`) are reserved for **Phase 3 bank sync** and are not displayed in Phase 1. The columns exist in the database but are not read or written from the UI.

### Reconciliation Status Bar
```
When unreconciled:
⚠️ Reconciliation needed  ·  $X,XXX.XX gap  ·  N scheduled  ·  N pending

When reconciled (all non-void transactions cleared):
✅ Fully reconciled — all transactions cleared
```
- `is_reconciled` = all non-void transactions have status `cleared` (AND at least one exists)
- When true, Actual Balance = Available Balance by definition (same computation)
- No bank comparison required in Phase 1

### Row Visual States
| Status | Row Treatment |
|---|---|
| `recorded` | Default styling |
| `scheduled` | Default + red icon in status column |
| `in_flight` | Amber/orange row background tint + red icon + tooltip indicator |
| `pending` | Subtle blue-gray tint + yellow icon |
| `cleared` | Subtle green tint or no tint (understated) + green icon |
| `void` | All text struck through, row grayed out |

### Inline Editing
- Click any editable cell → cell becomes an input field
- Tab key moves to next editable cell in row
- Enter key saves current cell
- Escape key cancels edit and reverts to prior value
- Autosave on blur (clicking away from cell)
- Debit and credit fields disable each other reactively

### Sched. Date Field (Column J)
- **Edit mode:** HTML date picker input; narrow column (date only, no label text)
- **Clear button:** × appears next to the input when a date is set; `onMouseDown` clears the field without triggering blur-save prematurely
- **Read mode:** Formatted date (`MM/DD/YYYY`) if set; empty cell if null
- **Tab order (new row):** Notes → Sched. Date → Save (Tab/Enter on Sched. Date submits the row)
- **Tab order (edit row):** Notes → Sched. Date → blur triggers autosave
- **Status icon preview:** Scheduled icon appears in Column E while editing as soon as a date is typed — no save required
- **Status dropdown:** `Scheduled` option appears in the dropdown only when `scheduled_date IS NOT NULL`; hidden when null (no date = no scheduled state possible)

### Month Navigation
- Tab bar at bottom of register: January through December + Yearly Summary
- Current month highlighted/underlined
- Past months show lock icon 🔒 on hover
- Future months are accessible (for pre-entry of scheduled items) but show no lock

### Locked Month Banner
```
🔒 This register is closed (January 2026)
All entries are read-only.
[ Unlock to Edit ]
```

### Mobile Responsiveness
- Progressive Web App (PWA) — installable on mobile home screen
- Offline-first: register readable without network; edits queue and sync on reconnect
- On mobile: columns collapse gracefully; Description and Balance always visible
- Status icons remain full-size on all screen sizes
- Touch targets minimum 44x44px for all interactive elements

## 17. Validation Rules

### Transaction Row Validation
| Field | Rule |
|---|---|
| Date | Required; valid MM/DD/YYYY format; future dates allowed |
| Description | Required; max 255 characters; not blank |
| Debit | Positive decimal, max 2 decimal places; cannot coexist with Credit |
| Credit | Positive decimal, max 2 decimal places; cannot coexist with Debit |
| Check # | Positive integer only; optional |
| At least one of Debit/Credit | Row must have either debit or credit to compute balance |
| Notes | Free text; no format constraints; no effect on status |
| Sched. Date | Optional; valid date; stored as `YYYY-MM-DD`; drives `scheduled`/`in_flight` status on save |

### Balance Validation
| Rule |
|---|
| Balance column H is never editable |
| Opening balance is never editable after being set (except by admin unlock) |
| Running balance recomputes on every save |
| Void rows produce null balance and do not affect running total |

### Account Validation
| Field | Rule |
|---|---|
| Routing number | Exactly 9 digits; numeric only |
| Account number | 8–17 digits; numeric only |
| Nickname | Required; max 50 characters |

## 18. Bank Sync (Optional — v2)

Bank sync is an **optional enhancement** for reconciliation assistance. It is not required for the core register to function.

### Integration: Plaid
- Plaid Link for secure bank connection
- Read-only access — no write permissions to bank ever
- Transactions fetched for matching purposes only

### Sync Model
- Bank transactions are fetched and stored separately from ledger transactions
- App attempts to **match** bank transactions to existing ledger entries
- Matched = AI suggests marking ledger entry as `pending` or `cleared`
- Unmatched bank transaction = AI flags: *"Bank shows a $45.96 Walgreens on 3/18 — do you want to add this to your register?"*
- User always has final authority — no auto-merge, ever

### What Bank Sync Never Does
- Never overwrites a user-entered transaction
- Never auto-creates ledger entries
- Never auto-changes a transaction status
- Never deletes any ledger data

## 19. Tech Stack Recommendation

### Frontend
| Layer | Technology | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Framework | React + TypeScript | Component-based, type-safe, excellent ecosystem |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS | Utility-first, responsive, consistent |
| PWA | Vite PWA plugin | Offline support, mobile installable |
| Local cache | IndexedDB (via Dexie.js) | Offline-first reads |
| State | Zustand or React Query | Lightweight, predictable |

### Backend
| Layer | Technology | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Platform | Supabase | Managed Postgres + Auth + RLS + Realtime |
| Database | PostgreSQL | ACID compliant, ideal for financial ledger |
| Auth | Supabase Auth | Built-in MFA, JWT, session management |
| Security | Row-Level Security | User data isolation at database level |
| API | Supabase auto-generated REST + custom Edge Functions | |

### AI
| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Model | Anthropic Claude (claude-sonnet) |
| Integration | Anthropic API via Supabase Edge Function |
| Context | Per-session reconciliation context passed with each request |

### Bank Sync (v2)
| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Provider | Plaid |
| Access | Read-only |
| Storage | Separate `bank_transactions` table — never mixed with ledger |

## Appendix A — Glossary

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| **Ledger Balance** | The authoritative balance computed from all user-entered transactions |
| **Current Balance** | Ledger balance relabeled as the bank-side reconciliation target |
| **Available Balance** | Balance computed from cleared transactions only; mirrors bank's available |
| **Actual Balance** | Ledger balance relabeled as the user's true spendable truth |
| **Convergence** | The state when Current = Available = Actual; fully reconciled |
| **Opening Balance** | The starting balance of a monthly register; carried from prior month closing |
| **Closing Balance** | The balance of the last non-void transaction row in a month |
| **Carry-Forward** | The automatic transfer of a closing balance to the next month's opening balance |
| **Reconciliation** | The process of confirming ledger matches bank; user-performed, AI-assisted |
| **In-Flight** | A scheduled payment whose date has passed but bank confirmation not yet received |
| **Void** | A cancelled transaction; excluded from all computations; never deleted |

---

## Appendix B — Key Rules Summary (Quick Reference for Developers)

1. Balance column H is **never stored** — always computed on read
2. Debit and credit are **mutually exclusive** per row — enforced at DB and UI layers
3. Opening balance is **read-only** after being set (except manual unlock)
4. Carry-forward is **one rule**: prior month last balance → current month opening
5. Scheduled icon is **auto-triggered** by `scheduled_date` (Column J) — `scheduled_date` is the single source of truth; Notes/Memos is free text only
6. **Nothing changes silently** — AI suggests, user confirms, always
7. Audit log is **append-only** — no modifications or deletions, ever
8. Routing and account numbers are **encrypted at rest** and **masked in UI**
9. Void is the only way to "delete" a transaction — **hard delete is never permitted**
10. All three balances **converge** when fully reconciled — this is the validation test
